            <p>This week I was I was sick the majority of time. Therefore I was
              unable to contribute much. I did hand calculation of the current
              controlled oscillator and tested the performance of the CCO. Cody and I
              were able to extract information from simulation and decide specs
              for other components. I also wrote the website for our team.</p>
            <p> What I plan to do the upcoming week: help Cody write verilog for
              the system and finalize spec for each component. I would also like
              to help Anil work on improving the classification accuracy and optimizing
              the algorithm so it best simulates our system</p>

            <p>This week I've worked on the digital components and worked with Rebekah on
              characterizing each component to determine what specs we want to use (eg.
              number of window counters per channel, current range of DAC, working current
              range of CCO etc). In addition, I've started writing the verilog for modeling
              our circuit.</p>
            <p>I also wrote some Matlab starter code to help Anil get started with
              programming. We discussed in detail how to manipulate the neural data
              we acquired online.</p>
            <p>Next week I will work with Rebekah to finish the verilog model of system</p>

            <p>What I’ve done this week</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Write Python / Matlab code to process data from M1 neural data
                in the monkey dataset</li>
              <li>Write Python code to improve understanding of how the control
                signals coming from the DSP works in the context of the window counter
                circuit (ended up not completing and moved onto other things when I had a
                better understanding of it)</li>
              <li>Feed processed data into ELM algorithm and test to see what results we’re getting</li>
              <li>Play with hyperparameters such as p (the number of window counter
                delays, which also changes the input vector size for the ELM),
                D (the number of hidden nodes in the ELM), time_bins (the size
                of time bin used for counting neuron firings when processing the data).</li>
              <li>Experimented with both multi-output regressional ELM (trying to predict
                x and y velocity using regression) and multi-class classification ELM types
                (directional detection discretized into n classes, I used n = {2, 4, 8} while
                experimenting) to evaluate performance metrics. Tried changing the number of classes
                to see its affect on classification accuracy.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>My plan is to write another Matlab script that sweeps possible values
              for hyperparameters as well and evaluates performance and picks out the
              optimal hyperparameters when run for a long time (e.g. overnight).</p>
