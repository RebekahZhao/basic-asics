            <p>This week I was I was sick the majority of time. Therefore I was
              unable to contribute much. I did hand calculation of the current
              controlled oscillator and tested the performance of the CCO. Cody and I
              were able to extract information from simulation and decide specs
              for other components. I also wrote the website for our team.</p>
            <p> What I plan to do the upcoming week: help Cody write verilog for
              the system and finalize spec for each component. I would also like
              to help Anil work on improving the classification accuracy and optimizing
              the algorithm so it best simulates our system</p>

            <p>This week I've worked on the digital components and worked with Rebekah on
              characterizing each component to determine what specs we want to use (eg.
              number of window counters per channel, current range of DAC, working current
              range of CCO etc). In addition, I've started writing the verilog for modeling
              our circuit.</p>
            <p>I also wrote some Matlab starter code to help Anil get started with
              programming. We discussed in detail how to manipulate the neural data
              we acquired online.</p>
            <p>Next week I will work with Rebekah to finish the verilog model of system</p>

            <p>What I’ve done this week</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Write Python / Matlab code to process data from M1 neural data
                in the monkey dataset</li>
              <li>Write Python code to improve understanding of how the control
                signals coming from the DSP works in the context of the window counter
                circuit (ended up not completing and moved onto other things when I had a
                better understanding of it)</li>
              <li>Feed processed data into ELM algorithm and test to see what results we’re getting</li>
              <li>Play with hyperparameters such as p (the number of window counter
                delays, which also changes the input vector size for the ELM),
                D (the number of hidden nodes in the ELM), time_bins (the size
                of time bin used for counting neuron firings when processing the data).</li>
              <li>Experimented with both multi-output regressional ELM (trying to predict
                x and y velocity using regression) and multi-class classification ELM types
                (directional detection discretized into n classes, I used n = {2, 4, 8} while
                experimenting) to evaluate performance metrics. Tried changing the number of classes
                to see its affect on classification accuracy.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>My plan is to write another Matlab script that sweeps possible values
              for hyperparameters as well and evaluates performance and picks out the
              optimal hyperparameters when run for a long time (e.g. overnight).</p>

            <p>This week I worked with Cody to determine specs of our system (input signal
              duty cycle, calculations to determine power consumption). I also studied
            analog-AMS and what to include in our modules.</p>
            <p>Next week I will be working with Cody to figure out detailed specifications
            as well as various testing strategies for the system.</p>

            <p>I continued working with Rebekah to determine more detailed specs of
              our system (input signal duty cycle, calculations to determine expected power consumption etc)
              I also wrote verilog for the digital portion of our chip and am currently working on the testbench verification.

            <p>I finished working on hyperparameter optimization by using the ELM algorithm
              in MATLAB to determine base line design specs that we’re going to go for in
              our design of the circuit. (hyperparameters include hidden layer node count,
              window counter sizes, number of classes for classification, and time bins for g
              rouping spike trains and some more)

              <p>Next week going to join Rebekah and Cody in designing analog
                portions of the circuit such as the current mirror array.</p>

              <p>This week I worked with Anil on studying the power consumption specificattions
                with respect to the algorithm's tolerance. At first we roughly calculated the power
                consumption from simply scaling the process and found out that to
                meet the power requirement of the paper we need to reduce drain current.
                However, after running simulation I found out that the threshold
                voltage of the transistor is too high. Therefore we have decided to
                operate in subthreshold to achieve power consumption in nano Watts range.

                I also ran Monte Carlo simulation on current mirrors to characterize 
                the standard deviation of process mismatch parameters. Anil has been
                running simulation with the data I provided. Once we collaborative solve
                this problem we will be able to plug this into our verilog model.

                Looking forward I will be studying sub-threshold circuit design</p>

              <p>This week I worked with Anil and Rebekah to figure out the power problem.
                Although we haven't solved it completely, we're on the right track and
                are starting to understand the steps we need to take in order to
                significantly reduce our power consumption (how much we can reduce
                Vdd by, size of current mirror array, etc).

                Also, this week I've worked on the verilog model. The window counter
                is tested and verified, and now I'm working on the CCO model.</p>

              <p>This week I’ve continued working on MATLAB, but now for a different
                analysis, Rebekah and I figured out that our current mirrors placed
                a random distribution of weights not around 0 but around 1, and I have
                been running MATLAB simulations to see how this change affects our
                decoding accuracy (it very significantly affects negatively unfortunately).
                I have been trying to come up with the reasons why this is happening
                and a possible solution for it. So far I have enough data to support
                the notion that this is happening due to all the data being stuck
                on a low gradient portion of the sigmoid function (used as activation
                function in hidden layer and implemented by CCO). I’m in the process
                of adjusting the steepness and the center of this sigmoid function to
                better improve the decoding accuracy and hence coming up with necessary
                restrictions (design parameters) for the CCO.</p>
